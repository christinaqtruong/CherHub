# CherHub - Node and Express Servers

### Overview

This is a compatibility-based "FriendFinder" application. This full-stack site will take in results from users' surveys, and compare their answers with those from other users. The app will then display the name and picture of the user with the best overall match.

Express is used to handle routing. And the app is deployed on Heroku so other users can fill it out.
